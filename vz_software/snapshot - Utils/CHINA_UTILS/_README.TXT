In this folder, I will put some Chinese appnotes, diagrams, source code list etc from 80's.
If you are interested and having problem reading them, I would be more than happy to help you to get them 
translated into English.
I started my Computer learning back to 1985 when my father and my mother brought a Laser-310 a.k.a. VZ300 
system in that year. Now I'm a professional software engineer with more than 20 years of Commercial 
software development experience.
I'm doing this to contribute to the vzemu mailing list and in memory of my father and the time we were 
together.

All documents I uploaded, to the best of my knowledge, are in public domain, please let me know if you have 
a concern , I will remove them once confirmed.
