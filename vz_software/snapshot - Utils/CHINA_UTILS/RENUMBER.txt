The two programs in the directory are from "Laser310 Microcomputer Software and Hardware System Analysis" Peng Xinyi

Created two files based on the code in the book
LASER_BASIC_P1.5C.txt
LASER_RENUMBER.txt

Then generate it with the command php hex_txt2bin.php
BASIC_P1.5C.vz
BASIC_P1.5C.7B04.bin

RENUMBER.vz
RENUMBER.74D3.bin

Bin contains only data and can be used to disassemble learning.

Due to errors in the recognition of program characters in the original book, there is no guarantee that the generated program will be consistent with the original code.

Hex_txt2bin.php is the source of the conversion script.

LASER RENUMBER
Features:

(1) Reprogram the BASIC program line number and modify the target line number parameters in the following statements: GOTO, IF...THEN...ELSE, GOSUB, RUN, LIST, LLIST, ON...GOTO, ON...GOSUB, ONERR, RESUME, DEL, POP, and RST statements with direct line numbers as arguments;

(2) It is preferred to use the display text area to store data, and the processing of 300 or less sentence line number parameters may not occupy the user program area;

(3) The first character of the line number parameter with error in the program can be changed into a letter (with A~J instead of 0~9), prompting the user to modify;

(4) When the memory is insufficient during processing, the current processed line number can be reported, so that it can be re-edited after the abridgement;

(5) After the two or more programs are spliced ??(the line numbers are not in ascending order), the re-editing can ensure that the respective target line numbers are not confusing;

(6) It can be automatically adjusted when a large line number (=60000) is generated;

(7) Fast speed and good security.

Software production method: After the machine code is sent into the memory according to the address, the first and last addresses are placed in the user program first and last address pointer units, and the disk or tape is stored; later, the memory is loaded into the memory by BLOAD (disk) and CLOAD (tape). . After loading with CLOAD, NEW should be executed to correct the program area pointer (if there is a BASIC program, you can use PRINT&PST to restore it).

Call method:
(l) This program must be able to process extended function statements under the support of Pl.5D system; P1.5D is to change the content of 7D2FH~7D39H in P1.5C text to "F5 E5 21 12 75 CD A4 06 C3 4A 1E", Change the content of 7B9FH to 44H. The command invoked is: RENUN first line number, line number increment; grammar rules are unchanged.

(2) Under the support of V2.0, the USR function can be called. The entry address is 74D6H. After executing POKE 30862, 214: POKE 30863, 116, the calling format is: A=USR(0)' first line number, line number Increment (note number 'cannot be omitted'); parameter usage is the same as P1.5.

note:
(1) This program is a normal phenomenon due to the use of display RAM, dot line interference and pattern characters on the screen during operation;

(2) Using MODE(1) will clear the program, and confirm the existence of the program before calling with USR;

(3) The length of the program changes after re-editing, please pay attention to whether the address related to USR, POKE, etc. in the program changes;

(4) No handling of REM, PRINT and other statements,

Note that the comments and screen prompts about the line number are still correct, and the contents of the statement using &ERL (error line number function).
