MONITOR is a Laser-310 monitor program. This program is similar to Apple II's Call-151. It can read and write memory, assemble, disassemble and so on. However, because the 310 of the 16K memory is basically only able to see the contents of the ROM, the machine with the 16K/64K card is installed, and this program is more practical.

command:
MON enters MONITOR by BASIC
Dxxxx disassembly
W write to memory
O Recording tape
E Exit MONITOR and return to BASIC
