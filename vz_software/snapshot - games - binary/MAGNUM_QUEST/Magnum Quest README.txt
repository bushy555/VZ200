--- VZ200 Magnum Quest ---

Retrieved from floppy disk 16 Nov 2019 by dave.

The game is on the .DSK image that the VZ emulator 'VZEM' supports.
1) Load VZEM
2) Mount floppy disk 1 to the MAGNUM_QUEST.DSK image (File --> Disk --> Mount)
3) Type :  RUN"MQ"


(A) All of the MODE(1) screenshots are also attached within the .ZIP file as .VZ snapshots with a simple slow BASIC routine to move the video ram from $7000-$77FF to/from $7D00-$84FF. Ie/, Runnnig any of the .VZ's will do nothing, until you do a 'RUN200' which will restore the graphic from $7D00-$84FF back to viewable video at $7000-$77FF. These have been kept in case someone wishes to embark on a project to re-jig this game back to a real floppy disk for a real VZ Floppy disk drive.


(B) MQ-NINV.VZ is an 'inversed' copy of the main Magnum Quest program, should you wish to inverse the screen. However the introductory picture is no longer part of this main loader. You will need to ERA"MQ" on the disk image, load MQ-INV.VZ into the emulator, and then SAVE"MQ" 


(C) Also included in the .ZIP is the complete walkthrough of the game.
