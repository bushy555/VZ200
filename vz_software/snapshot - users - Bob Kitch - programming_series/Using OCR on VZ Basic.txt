Using OCR on VZ Program Listings
RBK 4 Feb 2021

This is a method of converting a high quality pdf image of a VZ Basic program listing into a .BAS file ready for conversion to .VZ for introduction into VZ emulator.

1. Started with a  pdf scan in “Bob Kitch VZ Scrap Book” directory.

2. Loaded a pdf into Adobe Acrobat Pro 2017. This version is a bit smarter than freeby Adobe Acrobat Reader DC!

3. Edit>Select All should highlight all of the text in the pdf.

4. File>Export To>Text (Accessible)>Save as a txt file. Keep Adobe screen open for editting.

5. As a text editor I use freeby Notepad++ that is considerably smarter than MS Notepad. Open txt file in Notepad++ and clean out non listing stuff. Save txt file.

6. Select Language>V>Visual Basic (pretty close syntax to GWBasic, QB and VZ ROM II Basic)
This selection highlights basic keywords and variables to assist in correcting OCR errors. It is very good at highlighting OCR’s failure to discriminate between 0 and O and 1 and I that are hard to spot on the screen. Global character Search>Replace is handy for fixing character recognition errors too. ( ) ‘ and % not usually correctly recognised.

7. Edit away using the Adobe screen as reference alongside.

8. Good luck and save as a BAS file. Non VZ I know, but it can be run through a QB compiler to see if any more subtle errors remain. 

9. This is quite a rapid method with less than an hour per A4 page of text.
