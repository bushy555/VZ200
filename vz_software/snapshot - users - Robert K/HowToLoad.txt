Here are the instructions on how to load the game on those systems where it is maybe not too obvious.


Mattel Aquarius

First load the loader contained in _htron_aquarius.caq by entering "cload". Run it, and then load the actual program contained in htron_aquarius.caq.
Alternatively, you can use the cartridge file htron_aquarius.rom.


Jupiter Ace

Load the program from tape by entering
0 0 bload ht.bin


Sharp MZ

Press "L" and Enter.
The text "LOAD" appears on the screen, now load the .mzt cassette file.


Exidy Sorcerer

Insert the tape and type (using upper-case letters)
LOADG
to load the program, it will start automatically after loading.
Note: The .srr tape file can be loaded by the JSorcerer emulator. z88dk also creates a .WAV tape file, which is not included in the zip archive because of its size. If you need it (either for MAME or for running the game on the real hardware), compile the game on your own.


Mitsubishi Multi8

Insert the cassette, then type...
 MON
 R
 GC000
...to load and run the program.

Two different .WAV tape files are included: one that can be loaded by M.A.M.E, while the other one should be able to run on real hardware. Loading the .cas file in M.A.M.E. does not work yet.
