# VZ200_VZ300___1-bit_tunes
1 bit music snapshots and Z80 asm listings for the VZ200 and VZ300 8-bit computers.

The VZ200/VZ300 and Laser200/210/310 were 8-bit Z80A based computers built by Video Technology in 1983-1985.
They were not designed to be able to produce 1-bit music. Yet, here we are.

These .VZ files are snapshots for any of the VZ emulators, or, with appropriate utilities found elsewhere, can be converted into standard .WAV PCM files that can be played into the cassette port of real hardware (ie, a real physical VZ200 or Laser310 computer)
.ASM file listings are standard ascii source code listings.
